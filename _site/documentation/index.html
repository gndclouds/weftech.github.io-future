  <p>The following narrative is a short depiction how Nomad might leverage real-time data to uncover insights about an urban locale and identify valuable development opportunities.<br />¿ City Supervisor Rebecca Knope has been having a rough morning.
                    The long bus ride from the Richmond district is always an uncomfortable experience. She gets her usual cup of coffee before a walking into City Hall. She thinks about all of the zoning and development issues to address today, as her
                    assistant greets her and lets her know that there is a contractor waiting for her to talk about undeveloped properties on the waterfront. Rebecca can’t help but think about how many more visits she gets regarding renovation and development
                    since the city started publishing their data on Nomad nodes on the Nomad discovery platform.</p>
