Our findings can be found [here](http://www.williamfelker.com/bay-school-blitz).


In April of 2016 a group of secret project members helped in facilitating a blitz with The Bay School of San Francisco. The goal was to blitz the 'future of student life' at [Bay](http://bayschoolsf.org). We lead the students through two days of design activities exposing them to the ideals surrounding [thinking wrong](http://www.futurepartners.is/think-wrong-process). Afterwards the students returned to Bay to continue blitzing the rest of the week in preparation for presenting their radical changes to the school's administration.

##Tour de Pando

![](/content/images/2016/04/Tour-de-Pando-with-SP-Logo.jpg)

During spring break 2016 six Secret Project Members (coloqially know as Nomads) took a road trip from San Francisco, CA to Green River, UT. Our Goal was to determine the future of secret project and to consider if we need to take the project outside of California College of the Arts to make change at the scale that we felt was necessary.

Our findings can be found [here](http://www.williamfelker.com/tour-de-pando).

##Zoo Labs Music Residency 02.2016

Every couple of months [Zoo Labs](http://www.zoolabs.org) holds Music Residencies. During these two week long engagements several bands are able to push their music, business, and fanbase further. This is all within the effort to eliminate starving artists. At the beginning of this sprint there is a one day design blitz, which our secret project assisted with, focusing on [thinking wrong](http://www.projectmlab.com/Think-Wrong).

##Powerhouse Blitz


In February of 2016 several Nomads were contracted by [Future Partners](http://www.futurepartners.is/) to help with the facilitation of a blitz focusing on the future of energy in the United States. As of now that is all I can say.

#Secret Project Manifesto
**If your dream can be accomplished in your lifetime, you’re not thinking big enough. If design matters, if design can matter, then this is ground zero for a revolution.**

**It is time to put young minds in the drivers’ seats of this world. We are challenging ourselves to take on the biggest issues, challenges, and problems that our world and our people face.**

**It is time to find ways to use the system to fix systemic problems. We will start small and think bigger than anyone has any hopes of thinking.**

**We are a small design and art school with big plans for connecting to the most amazing people and organizations in the world in order to accomplish what governments and researchers and companies and nonprofits cannot do alone.**

**We believe that designers are the flammable glue that connects all these things — and sets them on fire.**

**We are designers, thinkers, students, strategists, revolutionaries, and people who care too much to sit on our thumbs and wait for an assignment.**

**We will engage our school and our cities and our friends and people and companies and organizations and governments who have money and power and positions.**

**We are fearless. We do not know enough to be afraid. We will not take no for an answer.**

**Stand back. We don’t know how big this thing is going to get.**

**Electrify your friends. Warn your enemies. We have legendary work to do. Get on our bus or get under it.**
