#Title


**Pervious:** How might we enable teachers to create a context that fosters independent learning?

**Updated:** How might we optimize for the amount of working knowledge needed for students to generate tacit (memory) based knowledge?

--------
#Abstract

This project explores how K-12 students are taught to consume knowledge as well as how they actually consume knowledge.  The changes in knowledge creation and dissemination, including the mass democratization of information, are directly impacting educational teaching methods, with educators asking whether current methods of teaching content knowledge remain relevant today.  Stemming from this study will be the consideration of how the world’s content knowledge can be mapped and automatized into an assistive technology to allow teachers and students to spend more time with higher order creative and critical thinking.

#Introduction

For most of the world’s history knowledge equaled power.  A moneyed, literate class of people within a given society typically maintained a monopoly on information.  From the history of the Greeks to Victorian literature, a comparatively small segment of the population could access the kind of knowledge that was required for entry into a certain class of work and society.  The advent of the internet over the past twenty years may be the greatest innovation in the democratization of information since Gutenberg’s printing press.  With such open access to the sum total of human understanding, how much time must be spent in America’s classrooms teaching information that will be readily available to anyone with interest access?  Memorizing historical dates, learning state capitals, singing the “president song” — should these become traditions of the past as time is instead spent on the critique and analysis of information to apply to our modern but challenged society?  

As opposed to a lack of access the overabundance of information is actually becoming a challenge to education and true understanding.  From an excess of "questionable" information to the omnipresent sharing of experience-based “knowledge” from people around the world, society and people have been saturated with data that cannot be fully processed let alone understood.  The current data glut will only grow as more of the world’s seven billion inhabitants gain reliable internet access.  As opposed to focusing on what to learn in a classroom, the question should be turned around to consider what shouldn’t be taught given limited time as well as how to efficiently process this ever-growing database of human history and knowledge.  

In order to foster a society in which all people have the ability to effectively contribute and consume from the system as it continues to scale, we need to look at our educational system. An educational system which has not changed in decades and which still focuses on the importance of rote learning will not answer the above challenges.  Often with a steadfast emphasis on statewide or national standardized exams, an overbearing commitment continues to the teaching of facts and answers rather than the critical thinking skills required for a global economy. If a job can be outsourced or automatized, it may indeed be; if an individual can create and bring new levels of understanding and analysis to a position, value is added.  Ultimately we need our K-12 students, especially high school students, to see education as not the receipt of information but the opportunity to create and recreate knowledge in combination with an exploration and pursuit of their own passions.  Ownership, creation, analysis, collaboration — these are the kinds of 21st century skills that students need. 

Thus the question posed above takes on greater urgency.  Assuming that humanity continues to evolve for the foreseeable future we need to study the best methods for consolidating facts and knowledge to teach the minimum viable quantity while pivoting to 21st century skills.  Given the rate of technological advances, studying the creation of a program that would continually process new information and produce the critical 1% of content that will ground students in the history of the world could have great benefit to students, teachers, and society alike.

##Research

###Prototype 4.1 [How do you ...]

Concept:
This prototype utilized three broad questions which were printed on 2'x2' posters to poll - How do you know what you know?, What do you need to know?, and How do you learn what you don't know?.The posters were placed at heavy trafficked hallways at the CCA SF campus for a period of 7 days. This prototype focused on the understanding how students used the critical thinking skills they have to interact with the collective knowledge of society. In doing this I was hoping to understand how students applied their skill to break down a topic which they were unfamiliar with, so that they could come familiar with it and use that knowledge to create something new.

###Prototype 5.1 [The Bible Effect]

Concept:
This prototype consisted of six small posters placed on the CCA SF campus and the Bay School campus. Each poster had the phrase, "Tell me what you know about _____". The blank was filled randomly from individuals from both campuses who were given the prompt to fill in the blank about picking a topic from pop culture. All posters were up for 5 days, and were planted with one phrase each to promote the act of writing thoughts on the poster regarding said topic. This change was made from the previous prototype after all three sharpies were stolen. So to reduce cost, the sharpies were not provided again. The goal was to glean an understanding on how people perceived societal knowledge and specifically what aspects of the topic in the blank were top of mind. This was based on the assumption that if one was asked to describe something, they would most likely lead with what was top of mind regarding given topic. Thus mimicking how we would potentially teach someone about a topic area.

###Prototype 6.1 [4 of a kind]

Concept:
This prototype was one 4'x4' poster with information on a fictitious topic conveyed 4 different ways (photo of fictitious object, vivid narrative explanation, bulletin point facts about fictitious topic, and short cause and effect. One poster was placed at CCA SF and one poster was placed at the Bay School. Each piece of information conveyed was covered by a piece of paper to reduced content bias based on the displayed form. Once each flap was opened it would reveal the information and a number 1 - 4, which corresponded to a "vote log" displayed next to the main poster. The goal was to access what type of informational format people gravitated towards assuming it was something they had not heard of before, hence the fictious topic.

##Prototype 6.1 [4 of a kind]


**Option 01**

Buddha Bear, also known as the lotus flower panda, was discovered in the early 19th century in India. The Buddha Bear lives near the aquatic lotus flower pads. The bears average in size from 100 to 200 pounds and usually mimic the colors of a lotus plant, making them pink, black and white. They are named after the Buddha since they are known for being one of the calmest bears on the planet. The bears often are seen sitting among the lotus flower pads in a Native American position with paws crossed similar to that of a Buddha in a very zen like state. The Buddha Bear has been on the endangered species list since the early 2000’s. They sleep up to 15 hours per day, and always rest with a half smile on their face.

**Option 02**

Imagine visiting a lotus flower pond in India and seeing a pink, white and black fuzzy bear sitting in between all the beautiful small ornate floating lotus flowers. The 100 to 200 pound bears would be sitting Native American Style with their hands folded in a zen like state surrounded by the small green, pink and white flowers that are floating above the water. The Buddha Bear, as they are called, sit with eyes closed and wear a smile upon their face deeply resting and pondering what is next in their day.

**Option 03**

Buddha Bear

* 100 to 200 pounds.
* coloring pink, black or brown and white

#Insights

>Experience based memories are more rich in knowledge gained then **** based memories.



>Fostering critical thinkers will naturally cultivate "learners (students) who know how to learn".



>We are creatures who thrive on the consumption of experiences. And the internets the best way we have ever had to share them with others.



>Our brains are best at making desertion based on memories of experiences not by necessarily thinking about them.

J: "Do you know how to make wheat?"
W: "Well know but I could find out."
J: "We are already relaying on other to preform ...."

W (Later that day): "So why to have an AI help keep tabs on what knowledge is linked to what and then when we need to dig deeper into a topic or set of ideas we can call on the AI for a summery and then choose to take that knowledge and run with it. Or we can strap in and dig deep."
