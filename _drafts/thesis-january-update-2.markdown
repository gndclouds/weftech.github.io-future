##Research

###Prototype 1.1 [Alex]

Thought:
As humanity streams forward it will become more difficult to teach to our collective knowledge. So we will need to become more diligent about what we teach and more efficient at what we teach.

Concept:
Create a computing system which tracks the most “Impactful Events” throughout history. Examples could include the building of the hadron collider, 9.11 and the following wars, Tesla open sourcing its patents, first music video to reach 1 billion views, 50th super bowl, or the fall of Facebook. This system would track sequence of events and stick them together into a comprehensive view of how we got to where we are today. Students would then focus on the why we got to this point through the use of several core methodologies.

###Prototype 2.1 [Freeassociation]

Thought:
The way we draw our connection between object are just as important as the content is self. Lets explore what types of connections we draw between objects.

Concept:
Take the classic ink blot test and replace them with icons from the noun project. Then tell the participants “I would like you to list the first thing which come to your head when you see both icons” i.e. how do you draw an association between them.

###Prototype 4.1 [How do you ...]

Thought:
Create 4 posters with sever probes about methods people use to discover new things. Then push for integrating those into Alex. Prototype 01.2 [Alex] or Prototype 01.1 [Alex]
