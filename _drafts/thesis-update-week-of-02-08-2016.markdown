Prototype 4.1 [How do you ...]

Concept: 
This prototype utilized three broad questions which were printed on 2'x2' posters to poll - How do you know what you know?, What do you need to know?, and How do you learn what you don't know?.The posters were placed at heavy trafficked hallways at the CCA SF campus for a period of 7 days. This prototype focused on the understanding how students used the critical thinking skills they have to interact with the collective knowledge of society. In doing this I was hoping to understand how students applied their skill to break down a topic which they were unfamiliar with, so that they could come familiar with it and use that knowledge to create something new. 


Prototype 5.1 [The Bible Effect]

Concept: 
This prototype consisted of six small posters placed on the CCA SF campus and the Bay School campus. Each poster had the phrase, "Tell me what you know about _____". The blank was filled randomly from individuals from both campuses who were given the prompt to fill in the blank about picking a topic from pop culture. All posters were up for 5 days, and were planted with one phrase each to promote the act of writing thoughts on the poster regarding said topic. This change was made from the previous prototype after all three sharpies were stolen. So to reduce cost, the sharpies were not provided again. The goal was to glean an understanding on how people perceived societal knowledge and specifically what aspects of the topic in the blank were top of mind. This was based on the assumption that if one was asked to describe something, they would most likely lead with what was top of mind regarding given topic. Thus mimicking how we would potentially teach someone about a topic area. 


Prototype 6.1 [4 of a kind]

Concept: 
This prototype was one 4'x4' poster with information on a fictitious topic conveyed 4 different ways (photo of fictitious object, vivid narrative explanation, bulletin point facts about fictitious topic, and short cause and effect. One poster was placed at CCA SF and one poster was placed at the Bay School. Each piece of information conveyed was covered by a piece of paper to reduced content bias based on the displayed form. Once each flap was opened it would reveal the information and a number 1 - 4, which corresponded to a "vote log" displayed next to the main poster. The goal was to access what type of informational format people gravitated towards assuming it was something they had not heard of before, hence the fictious topic.

Prototype 6.1 [4 of a kind]

Option 01

Buddha Bear, also known as the lotus flower panda, was discovered in the early 19th century in India. The Buddha Bear lives near the aquatic lotus flower pads. The bears average in size from 100 to 200 pounds and usually mimic the colors of a lotus plant, making them pink, black and white. They are named after the Buddha since they are known for being one of the calmest bears on the planet. The bears often are seen sitting among the lotus flower pads in a Native American position with paws crossed similar to that of a Buddha in a very zen like state. The Buddha Bear has been on the endangered species list since the early 2000’s. They sleep up to 15 hours per day, and always rest with a half smile on their face.

Option 02

Imagine visiting a lotus flower pond in India and seeing a pink, white and black fuzzy bear sitting in between all the beautiful small ornate floating lotus flowers. The 100 to 200 pound bears would be sitting Native American Style with their hands folded in a zen like state surrounded by the small green, pink and white flowers that are floating above the water. The Buddha Bear, as they are called, sit with eyes closed and wear a smile upon their face deeply resting and pondering what is next in their day.
