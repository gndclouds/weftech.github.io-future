*February 2015 - July 2015 @ Maker Media Labs*

At Make, I built and tested diverse projects ranging from electronics to computer coding through woodworking, circuitry and robotics. I collaborated with authors, editors and others to resolve problems with project instruction so the Make readers had a smooth experience. I tested the do-it-yourself kits, 3D printers, and new tools for possible review in the magazine or sale through Maker Shed. I also proposed my own maker projects to generate content in-house.

**Position Length:** 6 Months
