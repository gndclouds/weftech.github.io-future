*Ongoing project to be completed in May of 2016*

> How might an AI optimize the delivery of content knowledge so as to provide increased time for critical thinking instruction for students in K-12 education? 

#Research

This project explores how K-12 students are taught to consume knowledge as well as how they actually consume knowledge.  The changes in knowledge creation and dissemination, including the mass democratization of information, are directly impacting educational teaching methods, with educators asking whether current methods of teaching content knowledge remain relevant today.  Stemming from this study will be the consideration of how the world’s content knowledge can be mapped and automatized into an assistive technology to allow teachers and students to spend more time with higher order creative and critical thinking. For most of the world’s history knowledge equaled power.  A moneyed, literate class of people within a given society typically maintained a monopoly on information.  From the history of the Greeks to Victorian literature, a comparatively small segment of the population could access the kind of knowledge that was required for entry into a certain class of work and society.  The advent of the internet over the past twenty years may be the greatest innovation in the democratization of information since Gutenberg’s printing press.  With such open access to the sum total of human understanding, how much time must be spent in America’s classrooms teaching information that will be readily available to anyone with interest access?  Memorizing historical dates, learning state capitals, singing the “president song” — should these become traditions of the past as time is instead spent on the critique and analysis of information to apply to our modern but challenged society?  

As opposed to a lack of access the overabundance of information is actually becoming a challenge to education and true understanding.  From an excess of "questionable" information to the omnipresent sharing of experience-based “knowledge” from people around the world, society and people have been saturated with data that cannot be fully processed let alone understood.  The current data glut will only grow as more of the world’s seven billion inhabitants gain reliable internet access.  As opposed to focusing on what to learn in a classroom, the question should be turned around to consider what shouldn’t be taught given limited time as well as how to efficiently process this ever-growing database of human history and knowledge.  

In order to foster a society in which all people have the ability to effectively contribute and consume from the system as it continues to scale, we need to look at our educational system. A model which has not changed in decades and which still focuses on the importance of rote learning will not answer the above challenges.  Often with a steadfast emphasis on statewide or national standardized exams, an overbearing commitment continues to the teaching of facts and answers rather than the critical thinking skills required for a global economy. If a job can be outsourced or automatized, it may indeed be; if an individual can create and bring new levels of understanding and analysis to a position, value is added.  Ultimately we need our K-12 students, especially high school students, to see education as not the receipt of information but the opportunity to create and recreate knowledge in combination with an exploration and pursuit of their own passions.  Ownership, creation, analysis, collaboration — these are the kinds of 21st century skills that students need. 

Thus the question posed above takes on greater urgency.  Assuming that humanity continues to evolve for the foreseeable future we need to study the best methods for consolidating facts and knowledge to teach the minimum viable quantity while pivoting to 21st century skills.  Given the rate of technological advances, studying the creation of a program that would continually process new information and produce the critical 1% of content that will ground students in the history of the world could have great benefit to students, teachers, and society alike.

#Methodologies

For the scope of this project, there were three key ideas that I needed to test in order to understand how students learn within the current academic system. First was understanding the relationship between the teacher and the societal norms being taught.  Second, I determined how information is exchanged between teacher and student.  Lastly, I sought to understand how students integrate what they learn back into society.  

For each of the above three areas of study I tested four prototypes. The testing period took place over 3 months.  I developed a framework to map the potential points of knowledge transfer where an AI could assist a human.  The results were evaluated within this framework.  I focused on identifying key opportunity areas by which an AI could aggregate a larger pool of data than a human mind could and feed it back to the human in an optimized manner. This AI would take into account all possible positions to optimize for biases as well as presenting the information in multiple media formats in an attempt to optimize the consumption of the information so that the individual can become an expert more quickly.


##Prototyping
###Prototype 01.1 [Alex Card Game]

![](/content/images/2016/04/P-1-1-1.png)

![](/content/images/2016/04/P-1-1-1-Copy.png)

Create a computing system which tracks the most “Impactful Events” throughout history. Examples could include the building of the hadron collider, 9/11 and the subsequent wars, Tesla open sourcing its patents, the first music video to reach 1 billion views, 50th super bowl, or the fall of Facebook. This system would track the sequence of events and synthesize them into a comprehensive view of how we evolved as a civilization to where we are today. Students would then focus on why we got to this point through the use of several core methodologies. 

###Prototype 01.2 [Alex Bible Viz]

![](/content/images/2016/04/P-1-1-1-Copy-3.png)

How might AI take shape in a digital space? By using the same framework as bibleviz, map events in recent history together to build an environment in which participants make connections. Then use this as a method to probe how we discover content. 

###Prototype 02.1 [Free Association Inkblot]

![](/content/images/2016/04/P-1-1-1-Copy-2.png)

Take the classic ink blot test and replace them with icons from the noun project. Then tell the participants “I would like you to list the first thing which comes to your head when you see both icons”? (i.e. how do you draw an association between them?)


###Prototype 03.1 [How do you … ]



This prototype utilized three broad questions which were printed on 2'x2' posters to poll - "How do you know what you know?", "What do you need to know?", and "How do you learn what you don't know?".The posters were placed at heavy trafficked hallways at the CCA SF campus for a period of 7 days. This prototype focused on understanding how students used the critical thinking skills they have to interact with the collective knowledge of society. In doing this I was hoping to understand how students applied their skill to break down a topic with which they were unfamiliar so that they could become familiar with it and use that knowledge to create something new. 

###Prototype 03.2 [Question a Week]



In some of the more heavily traveled corridors at CCA and The Bay School of San Francisco place a drop box for people to anonymously drop questions. Once a week collect these questions and produce a thoughtful response which includes a video, audio, and written component. Then ask for feedback on how well the question was answered. 
 

###Prototype 04.1 [The Bible Effect]


This prototype consisted of six small posters placed on the CCA SF campus and the Bay School campus. Each poster had the phrase, "Tell me what you know about _____". The blank was filled randomly from individuals from both campuses who were given the prompt to fill in the blank by picking a topic from pop culture. All posters were up for 5 days and were planted with one phrase each to promote the act of writing thoughts on the poster regarding said topic. This change was made from the previous prototype after all three sharpies were stolen. So to reduce cost, the sharpies were not provided again. The goal was to glean an understanding on how people perceived societal knowledge and specifically what aspects of the topic in the blank were top of mind. This was based on the assumption that if one was asked to describe something, he or she would most likely lead with what was top of mind regarding the given topic. This might mimic how we would potentially teach someone about a topic area. 


###Prototype 05.1 [4 of a kind]


This prototype was one 4'x4' poster with information on a fictitious topic conveyed 4 different ways (photo of fictitious object, vivid narrative explanation, bulleted facts about fictitious topic, and short cause and effect. One poster was placed at CCA SF and one poster was placed at the Bay School. Each piece of information conveyed was covered by a piece of paper to reduced content bias based on the displayed form. Once each flap was opened it would reveal the information and a number 1 - 4, which corresponded to a "vote log" displayed next to the main poster. The goal was to access what type of informational format people gravitated towards assuming it was something they had not heard of before (hence the fictious topic.)

###Prototype 06.1 [Snapshot]


Using a script that I previously used for a "quantified self" project, capture peoples' desktops once an hour as well as log all of their keyboard commands and track their mouth movements over the course of a couple days to try to determine the ways in which they're interacting with the media.
